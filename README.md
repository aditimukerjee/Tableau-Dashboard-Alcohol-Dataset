I have used the makeover Mondays dataset — Alcohol Consumption by Country dataset. The dataset contains ranks of countries and liters of pure alcohol consumed per capita.
Link:https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w26


This alcohol consumption data is for 2019. This data represents alcohol consumption per capita for people who are over 15 years of age per population.


Here are the conclusions from the analysis:
- Alcohol’s effects can be detrimental to Benign being the highest alcohol consumer.
- European countries exhibit a trend of being major alcohol consumers.
- Slovenia has the lowest alcohol consumption per capita.
